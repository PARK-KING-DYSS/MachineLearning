# ML-based Parking Management System

Welcome to the ML-based Parking Management System repository! This project leverages machine learning algorithms to optimize parking space utilization and streamline the parking experience. 

## Overview
Managing parking spaces efficiently is crucial for urban infrastructure optimization. Traditional systems often face challenges such as manual monitoring, inefficient space allocation, and lack of real-time insights. Our ML-based Parking Management System addresses these issues by employing advanced machine learning techniques to automate parking space allocation, monitor occupancy in real-time, and provide data-driven insights for better decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Automated Space Allocation**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to dynamically allocate parking spaces based on demand, maximizing utilization.
- **Real-time Occupancy Monitoring**: Sensors and computer vision technology continuously monitor parking space occupancy, providing up-to-date information to users.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predicts parking demand patterns based on historical data, allowing for proactive management of resources.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A sleek web interface makes it easy for users to find available parking spaces, reserve spots, and navigate to their destinations.

## How It Works
Our system integrates data from sources including cameras and historical usage patterns. Machine learning models process this data to optimize parking space allocation and provide actionable insights. Users can access the system through a user-friendly web interface or APIs, making parking management seamless and efficient.
