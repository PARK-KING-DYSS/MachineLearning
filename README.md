## Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using EasyOCR, OpenCV, and Matplotlib

This repository contains a Python script for performing Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using EasyOCR for text recognition, OpenCV for image processing, and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- EasyOCR
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Matplotlib
- GPU (optional, for faster processing with EasyOCR)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install easyocr opencv-python matplotlib
```

# **Pre-Trained Files(.pt)**

1)  best.pt : 
```
- The term "best.pt" typically refers to a file named "best.pt" that is used in machine learning, particularly in the
context of deep learning models trained using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. This file usually contains the
 parameters (weights and biases) of a trained neural network model
that achieved the best performance on a specific task or dataset during the training process.

- The ".pt" extension commonly indicates that the file is in PyTorch's native format for saving model checkpoints
or state dictionaries. These files can be used to restore the trained model's state for further evaluation,
inference, or fine-tuning without having to retrain the model from scratch.

- In summary, "best.pt" refers to a file containing the parameters of a neural network model trained using
 PyTorch (or another framework that uses the ".pt" extension) that achieved the best performance during
training.
